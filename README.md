# Distributed Content Searching

A simple overlay-based solution that allows a set of nodes to share contents among each other. A set of nodes connected via some overlay topology. Each of the nodes has a set of files that it is willing to share with other nodes. Node x is interested in a file f. x issues a  search query to the overlay to locate a at least one node y containing that particular file. Once the node is identified, the file f can be exchanged between X and y.
